# Optimism

## Overview and Origin

Optimism was founded in 2019 by Karl Floersch along with Jinglan Wang and Kevin Ho, stemming out of the research group called Plasma. The idea behind the company is to provide better scaling solutions on top of the existing Ethereum blockchain. This stemmed from the existing problems trying to improve the sped and scaling of Ethereum without reducing the security of the chain and while keeping any solution as decentralized as possible. The company has gone through a 3.5 million dollar seed round of funding in 2020 provided by Paradigm and IDEO CoLab Ventures as well as a 25 million dollar Series A round of funding in 2021 provided by Andreessen Horowitz and bringing Joshua Stein into the company.

## Business Activities

Optimism is trying to deal with the scaling issues that exist with the current Ethereum blockchain. Currently Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second, and with Optimism's Layer 2 solution, transactions could be processed at a rate of 100,000 transactions per second. Optimism's unique solution involves Optimistic Rollups of transactions, which allows transactions to be batched and processed off-chain. These batches are then sent for verification to the main Ethereum chain, retaining the original level of the Ethereum blockchain, and additional security provided for the roadmapped Ethereum 2 blockchain. Compared to their main competitors such as zkSync, who use ZK rollups, Optimism is slightly slower but allows for full backwards compatibility with existing Ethereum smart contracts. Optimism's intended customer is any current or future user of Ethereum, as they are a public benefit corporation focused on scaling technologies, and Ethereum has a current market capitalization of $248 billion dollars. Optimism's Optimistic Rollups are implemented on an Optimistic Virtual Machine, which is written in its own runtime language.

## Landscape

Optimism is located in the decentralized finance domain of financial technologies. Decentralized finance is a novel area of financial technology and has been rapidly evolving over the past five to ten years. The major trends of decentralized finance have been to make payments, lending, borrowing, and trading available in a more efficient, fair, and open way. Innovations in cryptography, decentralization, and blockchain have allowed transactions in this space to be settled almost immediately, with no human involvement. They have also allowed for transactions to be executed by anyone with internet access, without the need for identity or income verification, something that is important for those in regions with governmental censorship. Optimism's main competitor within their domain, another company focused on improving scaling on the existing Ethereum network, is zkSync.

## Results

Optimism is an extremely novel technology, and has so far only been soft launched to users on the Synthetix decentralized finance exchange in January 2021. The main goal of Optimism and other companies in this domain is to increase the speed of transacations while minimizing cost. As of the end of March 2021, over 10 million dollars have been saved on the Synthetix platform across almost 104,000 transactions. Although it is still too early to judge performance - the platform will not enter community testing until the end of April - Optimism seems to be off to the right start. Compared to zkSync, Optimism seems to be a shorter-term solution. zkSync will take longer to get up and running with existing Ethereum based smart contracts, but will also address theft risks, reduced withdrawal times, almost unlimited volume scaling, and default privacy.


## Recommendations

If I were to advise Optimism, I would suggest that they offer comprehensive integrations with liquidity pool providers such as Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, and Bancor. I think this would be beneficial in that Optimism has made a promise of being able to provide generalized Ethereum smart contracts earlier than zkSync, and by integrating with these companies that already have pools based off of contracts, they will be taking over a large portion of the market before zkSync has a chance. This technology could be based off of the existing Solidity smart contracts that run on the Ethereum and Optimism virtual machines, as this is what was promised would be possible by Optimism.
