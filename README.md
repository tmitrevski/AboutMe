## Who am I? What is my background?
I am a product manager with five years of experience working in the commercial real estate technology industry. In my current position I guide the development of our web, mobile, and desktop applications. I also provide strategic product direction based on input from internal leadership, industry-leading clients, and software integration partners.

## What are my career goals?
I am interested in continuing to pursue the Product Management career pathway, while opening myself up to opportunities in larger organizations. I enjoy roles that are technically challenging, and provide a chance to move into Product Strategy. Long term, I like identifying what makes tech companies unique and valuable -- both as part of creating a complete tech platform and as business acquisitions.

## Why am I interested in FinTech as a career path?
FinTech interests me because I feel that there is a large opportunity for growth and inclusion of novel technologies, especially in the decentralized finance space. I also enjoy the large amounts of data available for machine learning applications.
